# random-quote-generator
A project I build as part of the Free Code Camp curriculum: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine

This was the the first project that I built using Javascript, the first one I put on Github (Free Code Camp uses CodePen instead), and the first one that I refactored. 

Key learnings: 
-Separate data into a separate object
-Use of jQuery/JavaScript selectors
-Organization of code into logical groups
